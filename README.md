# Face Space Social Media API

## Introduction

Welcome to the FaceSpace Social Media API! Here at FaceSpace we strive to give everybody the best outlet to make friends and share their thoughts. The best part of it, is then your friends can share reactions to your thoughts! What an age we live in. I was motivated to create this api so that my friends and I had a space to share our thoughts and then comment on those thoughts ourselves. I enjoyed developing thie API and honing my skill with MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Languages and Technologies

This API would not have been possible without MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the users, thoughts, friends and reactions.
